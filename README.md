# Recreating the history of computers on open source FPGAs

## 1940s

### Manchester Baby

The first stored program computer was the Manchester Baby, which ran its first program on 21 June 1948

I recreated this on a Blackice II ice40 hx4k FPGA using an LED panel to simulate the cathode ray tube used for memory.

### EDSAC

This was shortly followed by the Cambridge University EDSAC computer that ran its first programs on 6 May 1949.

The EDSAC was recreated on a Blackice I at the Chiphack event in Hedben Bridge in 2017.

## 1950s and 1960s

Nothing interesting happened in the '50s or '60s.

## 1970s

Computer video gaming started in the 1970s. 

### Atari 2600

The first successful console was the Atari 2600.

Here it is recreated on a TinyFPGA BX, playing the classic game, Adventure:

### Apple 1

Home computers also started in the late '70s.

In a garage in California Steve Wozniak and his friend Steve Jobs created the first home computer, the Apple 1.

Here it is running on the Blackice II

## 1980s

### NES

After the video game crash of 1982 in the USA, the Japanese became top nation for video consoles, and the first really successful one was the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Here is is running on an iCEBreaker up5k board.

### Gameboy

Nintendo also created the handheld computer game market.

Here is the Gameboy running on a Blackice Mx:

### Acorn Atom

In the UK the Acorn Atom was created.

Here it is running on a Blackice I:

### BBC Micro

It morphed into the BBC Micro:

### CP/M

There were also a few business computers, which ran the CP/M operating system.

Here it is running on a Blackice I:

## 1990s

Computer history came to an end in the 1990s.
